To that end, supplementing the efforts being made to generate open access wheat genome, pan wheat genome and other bioinformatic resources, we present the {GABI}-{WHEAT} panel of elite European cultivars comprising 358 winter and 14 summer wheat varieties released between 1975 to 2007. The panel has been genotyped with {SNP} arrays of increasing density to investigate several important agronomic, quality and disease resistance traits. The robustness of investigated traits and interoperability of genomic and phenotypic data was assessed in the current publication with the aim to transform this panel into a public data resource for future genetic research in wheat. Consecutively, the phenotypic data was formatted to comply with {FAIR} principles and linked to online databases to substantiate panel origin information and quality. Thus, we were able to make a valuable resource available for plant science in a sustainable way.

	abstract = {A major focus for genomic prediction has been on improving trait prediction accuracy using combinations of algorithms and the training data sets available from plant breeding multi-environment trials ({METs}). Any improvements in prediction accuracy are viewed as pathways to improve traits in the reference population of genotypes and product performance in the target population of environments ({TPE}). To realize these breeding outcomes there must be a positive {MET}-{TPE} relationship that provides consistency between the trait variation expressed within the {MET} data sets that are used to train the genome-to-phenome (G2P) model for applications of genomic prediction and the realized trait and performance differences in the {TPE} for the genotypes that are the prediction targets. The strength of this {MET}-{TPE} relationship is usually assumed to be high, however it is rarely quantified. To date investigations of genomic prediction methods have focused on improving prediction accuracy within {MET} training data sets, with less attention to quantifying the structure of the {TPE} and the {MET}-{TPE} relationship and their potential impact on training the G2P model for applications of genomic prediction to accelerate breeding outcomes for the on-farm {TPE}. We extend the breeder’s equation and use an example to demonstrate the importance of the {MET}-{TPE} relationship as a key component for the design of genomic prediction methods to realize improved rates of genetic gain for the target yield, quality, stress tolerance and yield stability traits in the on-farm {TPE}.},

	abstract = {Genomic-enabled prediction models are of paramount importance for the successful implementation of genomic selection ({GS}) based on breeding values. As opposed to animal breeding, plant breeding includes extensive multienvironment and multiyear field trial data. Hence, genomic-enabled prediction models should include genotype × environment (G × E) interaction, which most of the time increases the prediction performance when the response of lines are different from environment to environment. In this chapter, we describe a historical timeline since 2012 related to advances of the {GS} models that take into account G × E interaction. We describe theoretical and practical aspects of those {GS} models, including the gains in prediction performance when including G × E structures for both complex continuous and categorical scale traits. Then, we detailed and explained the main G × E genomic prediction models for complex traits measured in continuous and noncontinuous (categorical) scale. Related to G × E interaction models this review also examine the analyses of the information generated with high-throughput phenotype data (phenomic) and the joint analyses of multitrait and multienvironment field trial data that is also employed in the general assessment of multitrait G × E interaction. The inclusion of nongenomic data in increasing the accuracy and biological reliability of the G × E approach is also outlined. We show the recent advances in large-scale envirotyping (enviromics), and how the use of mechanistic computational modeling can derive the crop growth and development aspects useful for predicting phenotypes and explaining G × E.},

	abstract = {Best linear unbiased prediction ({BLUP}) is a standard method for estimating random effects of a mixed model. This method was originally developed in animal breeding for estimation of breeding values and is now widely used in many areas of research. It does not, however, seem to have gained the same popularity in plant breeding and variety testing as it has in animal breeding. In plants, application of mixed models with random genetic effects has up until recently been mainly restricted to the estimation of genetic and non-genetic components of variance, whereas estimation of genotypic values is mostly based on a model with fixed effects. This paper reviews recent developments in the application of {BLUP} in plant breeding and variety testing. These include the use of pedigree information to model and exploit genetic correlation among relatives and the use of flexible variance–covariance structures for genotype-by-environment interaction. We demonstrate that {BLUP} has good predictive accuracy compared to other procedures. While pedigree information is often included via the so-called numerator relationship matrix \$\$(\{{\textbackslash}user2\{A\}\})\$\$, we stress that it is frequently straightforward to exploit the same information by a simple mixed model without explicit reference to the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}user2\{A\}\}\$\$-matrix.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},
